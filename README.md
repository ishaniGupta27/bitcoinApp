# blockChainTechnologyApp

With the latest hue and cry, I decided to get my hands dirty with the blockchain technology both as a trader and a developer.With a love for distributed systems and future goals to continue working in the 
domain (Courses like: Cloud Computing with bloackchain technology and global scale data management),I had two goals for the project:

1. Creating a wallet for crytocurrency. 
2. Creating a mini blockchain to understand the ins and outs of the technology.

Getting Started

1. Run "server.js" and go to "http://localhost:8080/uiprice.html". This will show up the wallet I am working upon.
2. Open "runBlockChain.js" and add/remove the transactions you aim to be added in the blockchain and run it.


Prerequisites

Node v9.3.0.

Application Components:

1. The wallet can be used as any other wallet like coinbase,binance etc to keep the received/bought cryptocurrencies.
2. The blockchain technology is teh framework for many big application.I am still working on what all to be done.

Work to be done:
1. Completing the wallet for sending  the cryptocurrency.
2. Adding the function to generate the address for enabling receiving the currency.
3. Applying the blockchain framework.

Technology dived into:

Node.js, blockchain technology, md5 crypto.
